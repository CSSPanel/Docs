				There are many ways to run the panel, choose the most suitable way for you.
				<br />
				Note that you must have one of the above prerequisites in order to run the panel.
				<br />
				<b>Why not Web Hosting?</b> <br />

				to run the panel on a web hosting, as web hosting only supports static websites (.html, .css, .js, etc.
